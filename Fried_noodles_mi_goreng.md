Serving: 4

# Ingredients:
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 onion, diced or sliced
* 2-3 pieces chilli or more if you like it hot ;-) (optional)
* 500-600 grams of noodles (preferably thick noodles like hokkien or udon but any would do, even pasta!)
* 2 tbsp cooking oil
* Mixed chopped vegetables that you like (e.g. a combination of 1 carrot, half a handful of beans, 1/4 cup peas or corn, 1 red pepper)
* Choice of meat (300-500 grams of diced chicken/beef/pork)
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 3 tbsp sweet soy sauce (kecap manis); if you don't have this you can replace with 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce (optional)

# Steps:
Important: If the noodle needs to be pre-cooked, please do so according to the package instructions. A good tip is to mix it with some cooking oil when it's done to prevent from being sticky.
1. Fry the garlic, onion and chilli on medium heat until aromatic and the onion becomes translucent.
2. Add the diced meat. Fry for about 3 mins and add the vegetables. After 3-5 minutes add the noodles. Add all the sauce. Fry for another couple minutes.
3. Enjoy!!!
