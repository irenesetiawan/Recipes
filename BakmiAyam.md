Serving: 3-4 people

# Ingredients:
* Light soy sauce
* Dark soy sauce
* Fish sauce
* Sesame oil
* Sweet soy sauce
* Garlic, 6-7 cloves
* Mushroom
* 500 gr Chicken with bones (like chicken drumsticks)
* Sugar
* Salt
* Pepper (preferably white pepper)
* 2 packs of Egg noodles (fresh noodles, around 500-600 gr?)
* Spinach or other leafy vegetable, 1 bunch.
* Spring onion, 4-5 stalks
* Vegetable oil

# Steps:

* Chicken and mushroom sauce:
1. Mince all garlic, and chop thinly all of the spring onions
2. Boil 500 gr chicken with bones in about 2 litres of water. Take out chicken when cooked. Don't throw out the broth! Take off the meat from the bones, set this aside. Put the bones back in the broth. Continue to cook the broth in low heat. This step is different from the video.
3. Fry 2-3 stalks of the chopped spring onions in about 2 tbsp of oil, until brownish. Put the minced garlic in. Fry until golden brown. Put the chicken in, cook until meat is white. Add 2 tbsp of light soy sauce, 1/2 tbsp of sesameo oil, 1 - 1.5 handful of mushrooms, 1 tbsp sweet soy sauce. Cook for about 15 minutes.

* Oil:
1. Fry another 2 stalks of spring onions until almost browned. Then add about 3-4 minced garlic cloves. Fry until nearly golden brown. Then take it off the heat. The remaining heat from the oil will continue to fry the garlic. Be careful of burning the garlic!

* Noodles:
1. Add 1 tbsp of the oil we just made to the chicken broth that's still cooking. Also add 1 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp of salt.
2. Separate the egg noodles (they are usually stuck together in a sort of clump after stored in the fridge). Boil them in the broth for 2 minutes. Take the noodles out and place in a big bowl that's prepared with: 1 tbsp of the oil we made, 2 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tbsp fish saue, 1 tsp pepper, 1/4 tbsp sweet soy sauce. Thoroughly mix the noodles and all the sauce together. Boil some spinach (no need to chop them) in the broth until wilted and set aside.

* Serving:
1. Place noodles in serving bowls. Add some of the boiled spinach in the bowl. Serve the broth in a separate small bowl, topped with some chopped spring onion as a garnish (optional).
